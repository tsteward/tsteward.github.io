My first summer at Workiva, I worked on their Spreadsheets web application. My
second summer at Workiva, I worked on their Presentations web application. I
helped developed user interfaces and backend support for these. Resolved
software bugs and wrote unit test to prevent regressions. I participated in a
code review process to get feedback from other software developers.

## Garmin

Summer 2018

At Garmin, I worked on Garmin's marine chartplotters. I worked primarily on the
user interface. One thing I worked on was allowing the user to choose a
background image that is placed behind all of the menus in the product. I worked
closely with graphic designers to create the graphics and see how the looked on
the product.
