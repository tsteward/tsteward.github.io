## Workiva

Summer 2017, Summer 2019 â€” Present

My first summer at Workiva, I worked on their Spreadsheets web application. My
second summer at Workiva, I worked on their Presentations web application. I
helped developed user interfaces and backend support for these. Resolved
software bugs and wrote unit test to prevent regressions. I participated in a
code review process to get feedback from other software developers.
