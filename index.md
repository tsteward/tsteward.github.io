I am a student at Iowa State University pursing a degree in Computer Engineering,
graduating in Spring 2020. This site contains some examples of projects I have
worked on during my time at Iowa State University.

After graduation in May 2020, I plan to pursue employment doing software development. I hope to work doing something I enjoy well gaining experience in software development.
