For the class COM S 309, my group created an online version of the board game [Diplomacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy_(game)), a strategy game where players control armed forces to conquer the map. Our implementation featured functionality to control the game as well as create private chat rooms with any number of players. We wrote the front end in [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/) and the backend in Java and PHP.
