Using [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/), I created a web interface to display inforation from and control a simulated Mars rover for the class CPR E 288. The robot displys raw data from sensors and plots a map of the area it explores. The web interface connects to the robot through a java webserver that converts all of the data from http requests to UART transmissions.
